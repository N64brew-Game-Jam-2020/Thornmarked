# SDK

The Nintendo 64 SDK must be symlinked here in order to create builds for Nintendo 64.

Create a symlink named "ultra" that points to the "usr" directory inside a Nintendo 64 Developer OS/Library installation. It should be version 2.0L for Windows. The Irix version was made for the IRIX IDO compiler and will not work with GCC.
